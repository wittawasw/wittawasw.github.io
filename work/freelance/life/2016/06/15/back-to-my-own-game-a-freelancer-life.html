<h1>Back to My Own Game, a Freelancer and Family Life.</h1>

<p class="view">by </p>

<p>I started my career as a startup and when it failed, I became freelancer that
float around to many places. 2 years ago I started working as full-time
employee. It’s a good experiences and I think I’d gained something from it a
lot. Despite how much I hate commuting in a big city, being in a same venue as
one team is a nice feeling.</p>

<p>But I’ve had enough of that now. I think I’ve gained what I want. It’s time to
say no to all commuting and such. I’ll go back to being freelancer and spend my
time with family with ease.</p>

<p>If you’re not from Thailand or somewhere in this region, you probably think
freelancer is not a fine choice since it’s not come with other benefits. But
here in Thailand, I could make twice as much freelancing for oversea clients
more than being full-time employee.</p>

<p>Freelancer is also a good opportunity to manage my own time and place to be.
But it’s come with a lot of cost as well since I’m here in UTC+7 Timezone. That
means I have to somehow make my time available at night to support or
collaborate with others in Europe/USA. Not to mention that an uncertainty that
can happens(such as project’s ending sooner than expected) very easily
depending on how clients react unlike being full-time employee.</p>

<p>But this time it won’t be the same with all those past years. I do have some
plans to make this a permanent job for me. I’ll start working with
<a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">toptal</a> first and see how far I can with it.</p>

<p>I’ve heard of this site for quite some time. Stumble upon it while googling on
the work and I think the description on the site is quite good. In fact, I
really thought it’s too good to be true. An elite community with well-paid jobs
with a lot of demand for developers, also nice blogging community as well. And
since I have opportunity to join, now is the time to do it an begin my first
step back to being full-time freelancer.</p>

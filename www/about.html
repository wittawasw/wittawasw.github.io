<p>My name's Start. I'm a software developer specialized in website and server technologies. I usually prefer using <a href="https://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> but sometimes switch to <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> or others. </p>
<p>Right now, I'm currently employed as Ruby on Rails developer at <a href="http://codemy.net">codemy.net</a>. This site will be just a memo for me and for someone out there who's interested in similar topics to mine.</p>

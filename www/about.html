<p>My name's Start. I'm a software developer specialized in website and server technologies. I usually prefer using <a href="https://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> but sometimes switch to <strike> &nbsp&nbsp<a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>&nbsp&nbsp</strike> <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> or others. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This site will be just a memo for me and for someone out there who's interested in similar topics to mine.</p>

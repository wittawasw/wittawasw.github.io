I"Ó<p>Unlike most of my programmer friends, my first editor in programming is <strong>vi</strong> and
second is <strong>vim</strong> as a slightly more powerful editor. (I donâ€™t know about plugins at that
time). C# as a first programming language with mono as a compiler and vim as an editor.
vimâ€™s like a best friend back then. But when I started working extensively on C#,
I embrace VisualStudio as my new editor and tool to work on real application projects.</p>

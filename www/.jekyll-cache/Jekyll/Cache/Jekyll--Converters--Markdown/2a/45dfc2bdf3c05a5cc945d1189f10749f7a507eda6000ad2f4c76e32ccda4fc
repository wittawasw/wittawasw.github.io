I"–<p>Unlike most of my programmer friends, my first editor in programming is <strong>vi</strong> and
second is <strong>vim</strong> as a slightly more powerful editor. (I donâ€™t know about plugins at that
time). C# as a first programming language with mono as a compiler and vim as an editor.
vimâ€™s like a best friend back then. But when I started working extensively on C#,
I embrace VisualStudio as my new editor and tool to work on real application projects.</p>

<p>Some years after that Iâ€™ve started on the new path, Python and Ruby. Thatâ€™s when I went
to TextMate and eventually Sublime 2. Great experiences compare to big and slow
VisualStudio. But I still have to work with vim sometimes when I have to work on
server configurations.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, Iâ€™ve been working on a lot of server and deployment stuffs.
Swapping between vim and Sublime a lot in the process. Eventually, have some thoughts
that should I switch to using just vim to make thing easier.</p>

<p>Then the boss of my team just purpose that we should have a month of vim, a month that
we all have to rely on vim alone as a practice and also let others that normally do
everything in Sublime to try vim for certain period.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been a week since then. Iâ€™ve gained most of my speed in using Vim that Iâ€™ve
lost over years of Textmate and Sublime. One good thing that happened to me after I
switched back to vim is, My coding style have changed to the way that it will suit Vim
better than what I used to have in Sublime. Cleaner and mind a lot more when to use
spaces and newline. The markdown of this new post is also done using vim. Feel great
that itâ€™s worked with most of my works even with my blog posts.</p>

<p>As a reminder for myself and everyone else who stumble apon this page. Below is
my current <strong>.vimrc</strong> that I use in my OSX. I thought I will stick with this for a while
before I add anything new since thisâ€™s sufficient for me now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This .vimrc require <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">the_silver_searcher</a> to run properly.</p>

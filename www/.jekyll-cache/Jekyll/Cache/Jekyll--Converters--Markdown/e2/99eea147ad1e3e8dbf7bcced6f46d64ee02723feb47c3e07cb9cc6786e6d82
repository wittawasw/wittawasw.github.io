I"{<p>I started my career as a startup and when it failed, I became freelancer that float around to many places. 2 years ago I started working as full-time employee. It’s a good experiences and I think I’d gained something from it a lot. Despite how much I hate commuting in a big city, being in a same venue as one team is a nice feeling. But I’ve had enough of that now</p>

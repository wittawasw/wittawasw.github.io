<p>Itâ€™s been almost a year since I last updated this blog, to me, so many things happened and things are going to flow a lot faster this year. Iâ€™ve decided to do this since last month but I want to upgrade this blog from Octopress 2.0 -&gt; 3.0 and I just didnâ€™t feel like I want to do it at that time since I thought itâ€™d mean a lot of works to do the upgrade. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s clearly stated in <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">Octopressâ€™s announcement</a> about major upgrade to 3.0 that itâ€™d re-engineer the whole things. By turning Octopress into just Jekyll cli tools, people wonâ€™t have to learn the very similar things twice anymore when going from Jekyll to Octopress, Itâ€™s basically just Jekyll with a nice cli tool in Octopress 3.0</p>

<p>I started doing this for a while and found that itâ€™s much more easier than when I was struck with Octopress 2.0. Migrating is easy, I just moved my <strong>_posts</strong> folder over to this new repo and itâ€™s done.</p>

<p>But some plugins will not work immedietly but itâ€™s just a matters of relocating Ruby lib files and debugging some small errors that happened.</p>

<p>And with the new site in place Iâ€™ve decided to change a bit of front-end myself by using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3.x</a> and adding some cover to make it more appealing.</p>

<p>Right now, Iâ€™m done with this. If anyone still reluctant to upgrade your Octopress, I really recommend to do it. Itâ€™s worth your time since it wonâ€™t take long.</p>

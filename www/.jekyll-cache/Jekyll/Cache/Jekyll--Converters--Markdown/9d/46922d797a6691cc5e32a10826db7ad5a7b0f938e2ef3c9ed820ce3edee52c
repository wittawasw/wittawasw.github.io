I"¬<p>Unlike most of my programmer friends, my first editor in programming is vi and second is vim as a slightly powerful editor. (I donâ€™t know about plugins at that time). C# as a first programming language with mono as a compiler and vim as an editor. vimâ€™s like a best friend back then. But when I started working extensively on C#, I embrace VisualStudio as my new editor and tool to work on real application projects.</p>

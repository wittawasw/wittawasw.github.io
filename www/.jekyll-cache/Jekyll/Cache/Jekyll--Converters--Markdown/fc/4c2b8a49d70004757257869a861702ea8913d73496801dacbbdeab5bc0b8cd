I"y<p>It’s been almost a year since I last updated this blog, to me, so many things happened and things are going to flow a lot faster this year. I’ve decided to do this since last month but I want to upgrade this blog from Octopress 2.0 -&gt; 3.0 and I just didn’t feel like I want to do it at that time since I thought it’d mean a lot of works to do the upgrade….</p>

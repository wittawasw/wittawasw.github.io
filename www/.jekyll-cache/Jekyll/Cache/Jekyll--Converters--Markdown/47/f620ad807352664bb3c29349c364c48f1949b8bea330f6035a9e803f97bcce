I"®<p>I started my career as a startup and when it failed, I became freelancer that
float around to many places. 2 years ago I started working as full-time
employee. Itâ€™s a good experiences and I think Iâ€™d gained something from it a
lot. Despite how much I hate commuting in a big city, being in a same venue as
one team is a nice feeling.</p>

<p>But Iâ€™ve had enough of that now. I think Iâ€™ve gained what I want. Itâ€™s time to
say no to all commuting and such. Iâ€™ll go back to being freelancer and spend my
time with family with ease.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re not from Thailand or somewhere in this region, you probably think
freelancer is not a fine choice since itâ€™s not come with other benefits. But
here in Thailand, I could make twice as much freelancing for oversea clients
more than being full-time employee.</p>

<p>Freelancer is also a good opportunity to manage my own time and place to be.
But itâ€™s come with a lot of cost as well since Iâ€™m here in UTC+7 Timezone. That
means I have to somehow make my time available at night to support or
collaborate with others in Europe/USA. Not to mention that an uncertainty that
can happens(such as projectâ€™s ending sooner than expected) very easily
depending on how clients react unlike being full-time employee.</p>

<p>But this time it wonâ€™t be the same with all those past years. I do have some
plans to make this a permanent job for me. Iâ€™ll start working with
<a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">toptal</a> first and see how far I can with it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve heard of this site for quite some time. Stumble upon it while googling on
the work and I think the description on the site is quite good. In fact, I
really thought itâ€™s too good to be true. An elite community with well-paid jobs
with a lot of demand for developers, also nice blogging community as well. And
since I have opportunity to join, now is the time to do it an begin my first
step back to being full-time freelancer.</p>
